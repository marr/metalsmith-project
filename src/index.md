Tilt.com (formerly Crowdtilt) is the simplest way to collect money from a group.
During my time here I played a critical role in launching a serious competitor
in the online payments space. I revamped the contribution flow for users
enteringpayment information to send money to Tilt organizers. This led to a 15%
lift in conversions for users on our site. Recently, I built a new “Start a Tilt”[^tiltnew]
experience using ReactJS. This increased conversions by utilizing a lightbox
model instead of individual pages which more deliberately focuses users on the
creation form.

Added imaginative animations with CSS for hilighting areas of interest for the
user including call to actions for adding an image to their Tilt, visually
animated form validation and custom dropdown implementation. Individual form
elements were designed around Google’s Material UI framework.
