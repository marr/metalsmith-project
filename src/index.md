lift in conversions for users on our site. Recently, I built a new “Start a Tilt”[^tiltnew]
experience using ReactJS. This increased conversions by utilizing a lightbox
model instead of individual pages which more deliberately focuses users on the
creation form.

animated form validation and custom dropdown implementation. Individual form
