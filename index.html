  <h1>Dramastically Different</h1>
<p class="subtitle">By David Marr</p>
<h2>Profile</h2>
<p>Full-stack engineer with strong scripting/tdd/bdd/documentation habits for
maintaining performant build/continuous integration environments.  User focused,
Growth-Minded with technical, hands-on building experience including physical
and digital products using CAD and industrial design tool aides, as well as
latest software best practices.  Seeking an environment to build immersive
online experiences using my expertise executing crucial technology decisions in
both startup and enterprise environments. Enjoys working with designers to
prototype in the browser and automating all the things. Git fluent.</p>
<h2>Experience</h2>
<h3>Sr. Systems Engineer, <a href="https://tilt.com">Tilt</a>, San Francisco, CA, 2013-<em>present</em></h3>
<p>Tilt.com (formerly Crowdtilt) is the simplest way to collect money from a group.
During my time here I played a critical role in launching a serious competitor
in the online payments space. I revamped the contribution flow for users
entering payment information to send money to Tilt organizers. This led to a 15%
lift in conversions for users on our site. Recently, I built a new “Start a Tilt”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>
experience using ReactJS. This increased conversions by utilizing a lightbox
model instead of individual pages which more deliberately focuses users on the
creation form.</p>
<p>Added imaginative animations with CSS for hilighting areas of interest for the
user including call to actions for adding an image to their Tilt, visually
animated form validation and custom dropdown implementation. Individual form
elements were designed around Google’s Material UI framework.</p>
<h3>Sr. Software Engineer, <a href="https://saymedia.com">SAY: Media</a>, San Francisco, CA, 2012-2013</h3>
<p>SAY: Media is a technology and media company formerly known as separate

Drupal to craft a site-publishing application (Orion). Site authors and
editorial teams use Orion to develop “passion media” sites such as xojane.com,
readwrite.com and gardenista.com.</p>
<p>Developed and implemented user interface experiments within Orion sites for
optimization of headlines, traffic-driving content and user reactions within
articles to increase total engaged time-on-site.</p>
